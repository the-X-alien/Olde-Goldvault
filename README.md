Description

Olde Goldvault is a medieval-themed simulator where you manage gold, trade stocks, and take loans or credit to build wealth. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive experience with a medieval vibe.

### Features

Banking System: Apply for loans or credit lines based on your credit score, with dynamic interest rates and monthly payments.

Stock Trading: Buy and sell shares from over 100 unique guilds, with prices that change every few seconds.

Gambling Den: Try your luck with a coin flip to win or lose gold coins.

Portfolio Management: Track your shares, average buy prices, and profits or losses in a detailed table.

Medieval Theme: Enjoy a parchment-style design with the MedievalSharp font.

Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes for better viewing.

Progress Saving: Your gold, portfolio, and loans are saved locally so you can pick up where you left off.

Noble Titles: Earn titles like Squire or King based on your total wealth.

### How to Play

Set Up: Open the URL: https://olde-goldvault.vercel.app/

Banking: Enter your name, credit score, and choose a loan or credit line in the "Olde Goldvault" section. Submit to get funds.

Trading: In the "Ye Olde Stock Exchange," select a guild, choose to buy or sell, and pick a payment method (gold or credit). Use the quick buy button for single shares.

Gambling: Click the "Gamble!" button in the Gambling Den to flip a coin and test your luck.

Manage Debts: Pay off loans or cancel credit lines in the "Manage Thy Debts" section.

Track Progress: Check your portfolio, trade history, and noble title as you play.

Reset: Use the "Reset Thy Journey" button to start over.

### Technical Details

HTML/CSS: Uses a responsive design with a medieval aesthetic, including custom fonts and a gradient background. Media queries ensure mobile compatibility.

JavaScript: Handles game logic, including stock price updates every 3 seconds, monthly loan/credit payments every minute, and local storage for saving progress.

Dependencies: Requires an internet connection for the Google Fonts CDN (MedievalSharp font).

Browser Support: Works on modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

### Notes

The game simulates a medieval economy, so expect some randomness in stock prices and gambling outcomes.

Loans and credit have limits (e.g., max credit of 50,000 coins, loan cap of 1 billion coins).

Pop-up alerts guide you, but you can disable them via the checkbox in any pop-up.

### Future Ideas

Add more gambling games, like dice rolling or blackjack.

Include achievements for reaching milestones (e.g., owning 100 shares of a guild).

Improve the UI with animated stock price changes or kaching sound effects for trades.
